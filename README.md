## The Sliming Method

### We have learned several important lessons during this three day assignment.  

We have learned how important it is to utilize patience and understanding in a pair environment especially when frustrations are reunning high.

We have learned that sliming can get you so far, but eventually, you will get bitten by it.

We got a good amount of practice using bye bug and practicing decoding techniques.
